# Socketify

Socketify is a modern C++ web server framework inspired by simplicity and flexibility of projects like Flask and Express, but built for high performance and low-level control.  
It provides a clean API to build HTTP services with features like routing, middleware, and extensibility, while giving you the power of native C++.
